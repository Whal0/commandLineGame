# CLI-Based Python Text Game Engine

## Description
This project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) based Python text game engine designed to facilitate the creation and playing of modular mini-games. The engine supports loading and saving game levels stored in dictionaries that are serialized using pickle. It features a modular architecture allowing for the integration of various mini-games. Currently, the engine includes nine mini-games. The project showcases a strong understanding of programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms.

## Features
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with the game engine.
- Support for loading and saving game levels stored in dictionaries, serialized using pickle.
- Modular mini-game system with currently nine mini-games implemented.
- Implementation of various data structures and algorithms for game logic.
- Interactive gameplay experience with text-based input and output.
- Flexibility for extending the game engine with additional mini-games.
- Save and load features for resuming gameplay from a previous state.

## Technologies
- Python: Programming language used for developing the game engine.
- Command-Line Interface (CLI): Interface for user interaction.
- Pickle: Python module for serializing and deserializing Python objects.
- Data structures and algorithms: Implementation of various data structures and algorithms for game logic and mechanics.
- Modular design: Architecture allowing for easy integration of new mini-games.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a deep understanding of programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms through the creation of a CLI-based Python text game engine. By implementing features such as save and load functionality, modular mini-games, and serialization of game levels, the project aims to showcase proficiency in Python programming and software development principles. Additionally, the project provides an interactive and engaging gameplay experience for users while also serving as a platform for learning and experimentation with different game mechanics and concepts. For those wanting more you can create more levels on your own.
